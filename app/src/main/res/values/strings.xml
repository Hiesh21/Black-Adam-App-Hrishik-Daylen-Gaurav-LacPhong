Ayy, Panini, don\'t you be a meanie\n
Thought you wanted me to go up\n
Why you tryna keep me teeny? I\n
It\'s a dreamy, wished it on a genie\n
I got fans finally, ain\'t you wanting them to see me? I\n
I thought you want this for my life, for my life\n
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied\n
Just say to me, what you want from me\n
Just say to me, what you want from me\n
Ayy, Panini, don\'t you be a meanie\n
Thought you wanted me to go up\n
Why you tryna keep me teeny now?\n
Now they need me, number one on streaming\n
Oh yeah, you used to love me\n
So what happened, what's the meaning? I\n
I thought you want this for my life, for my life\n
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied\n
Now when it's all done, I get the upper hand\n
I need a big Benz, not another fan\n
But I still want you as a fan\n
I'ma need to sit down, don't mean to make demands\n
But I need you to\n
Say to me, what you want from me\n
Just say to me, what you want from me\n
Daytrip took it to 10 (hey)</string>
